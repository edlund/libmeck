## Warning

This is a work in progress. Things can and will change, consider
the API experimental and volatile.

## Overview

`libmeck` is a game development library based on `SDL2`, `SDL-TTF`,
`SDL-IMG` and `SDL-Mix`. It takes its C++11-style SDL wrappers from
`libSDL2pp` and its application/controller style of event handling
from `libpup`.

Please take a look at `libSDL2pp` "C++11 bindings/wrapper for SDL2"
if you are looking for a good wrapper library. It is can be found at:

https://github.com/libSDL2pp/libSDL2pp

Code taken from `libSDL2pp` is most often significantly altered (in terms
of code format and a number of small, pedantic changes) and is probably
not representative of the original software.

Read `LICENSE.md` for more information.
